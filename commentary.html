          <h2 class="entry-title">A Novel Approach for Instrumental Variable Estimation</h2>
          <p>
            Instrumental variables can allow causal claims when treatments are endogenous, but many IV designs are fragile:
            instruments are reused and the exclusion restriction is hard to defend.
            A common fix is hiding in plain sight: modeling the first stage flexibly. 
            Together with Christopher Schwarz and Christian Oswald, we explain this approach in a forthcoming paper in <em>International Studies Quarterly</em>.

          <p>
            When the relationship between an exogenous source of variation and an endogenous regressor is non-linear,
            flexible first stages (splines / generalized additive models) can extract distinct components of variation.
            Those components can strengthen relevance, reduce post-instrument bias, and in some settings help identify more
            than one endogenous effect from the same source.
          </p>
              
              <p>
                A key move in the paper is conceptual: distinguish the <em>source</em> of exogenous variation from the
                <em>instrument(s)</em> used in estimation. Researchers often treat a variable <em>z</em> as “the instrument.”
                But identification comes from how <em>z</em> maps on to the endogenous variable(s). If that mapping is
                non-linear, different functions of <em>z</em> can capture different parts of the exogenous variation.
              </p>

              <p>
                Empirically, the paper develops a control-function approach based on <strong>two-stage residual inclusion (2SRI)</strong>:
                estimate flexible first stages for each endogenous variable as a function of <em>z</em>, extract residuals,
                then include those residuals in the outcome model to correct for endogeneity while keeping the first stage
                non-linear. This approach improves relevance when linear approximations underfit, and it makes it easier to
                model settings where the same exogenous source plausibly shifts multiple determinants of the outcome.
              </p>

              <p>
                The paper also treats “multiple identification” as an empirical question. One source can only identify
                multiple endogenous effects if the fitted first-stage components are <strong>functionally distinct</strong>.
                If they are too similar, the system becomes near-singular: estimates turn unstable and inference becomes
                sensitive to small perturbations. To address this, we introduce diagnostics that screen for
                near-degeneracy and precision loss, making clear when the data support the identification claims and when
                they do not.
              </p>

              <p>
Empirically, the paper shows that exploiting non-linearities is not just a theoretical
curiosity but materially changes what researchers can learn from data. In Monte Carlo
simulations, we demonstrate that standard IV strategies fail when a single source of
exogenous variation affects multiple endogenous variables, a situation that produces
post-instrument bias even when first-stage F-statistics are large. By contrast, when the
first stage is modeled flexibly, the same source of variation can recover unbiased causal
effects, provided the non-linear components are functionally distinct.
</p>

<p>
A key result from the simulations is that the amount of non-linearity required for
identification is often modest. Even slight departures from linearity, imperceptible in
linear diagnostics, are sufficient to identify multiple endogenous effects in large samples.
</p>

<p>
We illustrate these ideas in two applied settings. First, we revisit prominent work on
democracy aid and democratization. Modeling the first stage non-linearly substantially
strengthens instrument relevance and reveals that a single donor-based instrument predicts
multiple endogenous variables. Once all resulting pathways are accounted for using a
control-function approach, the apparent causal effects of democracy aid attenuate and
lose statistical significance. Taken together with recent replication work, the evidence
suggests that more democracy aid from a larger set of donors does not robustly cause
democratic improvement.
</p>

<p>
Second, we apply the framework to economic growth models that use population size as a
common instrument for trade, trade openness, foreign aid, foreign direct investment, and export
sophistication. Flexible first stages uncover pronounced non-linear relationships between
population and these variables, relationships that linear specifications miss entirely.
However, diagnostic tests reveal that some of these first-stage components are too similar
to support simultaneous identification. This allows us to show when population is an
untenable instrument and when combining conceptually related variables can restore
numerical stability.
</p>

<p>
Across applications, we show that flexible first stages can
strengthen weak instruments, clarify when exclusion restrictions fail, and sometimes
recover multiple causal effects from a single source of variation. Just as importantly,
the diagnostics make clear when the data do not support such claims. Rather than treating
instrument validity as a matter of faith, the approach turns it into an empirical question.

    <p>
      Since American forces captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, plunging the country into uncertainty, there have been hopes for a transition to democracy, the stabilization of its economy, a reduction in drug trafficking and conditions that might allow millions of Venezuelans abroad to return home.
      But one factor will impede efforts at stabilizing the country: Venezuela’s hard-to-control border with Colombia, a shadow security zone that serves as a sanctuary and trafficking corridor for armed and dangerous organizations.

    <p>
      Syria’s rebel leader, Ahmed al-Sharaa, has defended his decision to fill his cabinet with wartime loyalists and delay 
      constitutional and electoral processes, describing these moves as pragmatic necessities for the country’s fragile transition.
      At the same time, he has called for the disarmament of all rival factions, especially the Kurds in northern Syria. 
      Will the group’s past alliances shape its governance? Can a group with such a violent legacy chart a path to inclusive peace?

    <p>
      Ethiopia reached a peace agreement with the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) rebels this month.The Nov. 2 deal 
      follows two years of fighting that killed about 500,000 people and displaced 3 millionfrom Tigray, a region in northern Ethiopia.
      Article 6 of the agreement lays out the terms for disarmament, demobilization and reintegration of theTPLF combatants. But these types of programs fail
       almost half the time. Will the Ethiopian peaceagreement hold — and can Ethiopia avoid another conflict? My research suggests alasting peace will require 
      demobilization and reintegration plans that ensure the economic and social well-being of rebel commanders and combatants.
