        <h2 class="post-title">Sharpening Blunt Instruments: Exploiting Non-Linearities to Enhance Identification</h2>
        <p class="post-meta">Forthcoming in <em>International Studies Quarterly</em></p>

        <p>
          Instrumental variables (IV) are a workhorse of causal inference in political science and international relations.
          We reach for IV when the treatment we care about is endogenous—because reverse causality, omitted variables,
          selection, or measurement issues make simple regression comparisons misleading. But IV designs are often fragile
          in practice. Instruments can be weak, they can violate exclusion, and—most commonly—the same “plausibly exogenous”
          source of variation is used across many studies to instrument many different regressors. Over time, that reuse
          exposes a basic problem: if an instrument plausibly shifts multiple determinants of the outcome, it becomes hard
          to defend the claim that it affects the outcome only through the one endogenous variable a given paper happens
          to instrument.
        </p>

        <p>
          This forthcoming paper in <em>International Studies Quarterly</em>,
          <strong>“Sharpening Blunt Instruments: Exploiting Non-Linearities to Enhance Identification,”</strong>
          offers a practical way to get more identification leverage out of common instruments—without treating them as
          magically single-channel. The core idea is simple: stop assuming the first stage is linear. In many applications,
          the relationship between an exogenous source of variation and an endogenous regressor is non-linear. If we model
          that first stage flexibly (using splines or generalized additive models), the same source of exogenous variation
          can generate <em>distinct</em> components of variation that are useful for identification.
        </p>

        <div class="subhead">A key distinction: the source of variation is not the instrument</div>

        <p>
          A conceptual move in the paper is to separate the <strong>source of exogenous variation</strong> from the
          <strong>instrument(s)</strong> used in estimation. Researchers often treat a variable <em>z</em> as “the instrument.”
          But in practice, what powers identification is not <em>z</em> itself—it is the relationship between <em>z</em> and
          the endogenous regressor(s). If that relationship is non-linear, then different functions of <em>z</em> can capture
          different parts of the exogenous variation. Those parts can behave like distinct instruments, even though they
          originate in the same underlying source.
        </p>

        <p>
          This matters because it clarifies what many applied literatures are already doing implicitly: leveraging one
          exogenous source to learn about multiple endogenous processes—sometimes responsibly, sometimes not. The paper’s
          goal is to make that logic explicit, model it directly, and diagnose when it succeeds versus when it becomes
          numerically fragile.
        </p>

        <div class="subhead">The method: flexible first stages + control functions (2SRI)</div>

        <p>
          Empirically, the paper develops a control-function approach based on
          <strong>two-stage residual inclusion (2SRI)</strong>. The workflow is straightforward:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Estimate flexible first stages</strong> for each endogenous variable as a function of the exogenous source <em>z</em> (e.g., splines / GAMs).</li>
          <li><strong>Extract first-stage residuals</strong> (the endogenous components not explained by the exogenous source).</li>
          <li><strong>Include those residuals in the outcome model</strong> to correct for endogeneity while allowing the first stage to be non-linear.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Modeling the first stage flexibly can improve identification in three ways. First, it can strengthen relevance
          when the true relationship is non-linear. Second, it can reduce post-instrument bias when <em>z</em> plausibly
          affects the outcome through multiple endogenous channels and those channels are modeled directly. Third, under
          specific conditions, one exogenous source can support identification of more than one endogenous effect.
        </p>

        <div class="subhead">When can one source identify multiple endogenous effects?</div>

        <p>
          The paper does not claim that one instrument can identify everything. Instead, it specifies a condition:
          identification of multiple endogenous effects is possible when the first-stage relationships generated by <em>z</em>
          are <strong>functionally distinct</strong>—not just scaled copies of each other. If the fitted components are too
          similar, the system becomes close to singular. In that case, estimates can become unstable, standard errors can
          explode, and results can be driven by numerical artifacts rather than genuine identifying variation.
        </p>

        <p>
          To make this transparent, the paper introduces diagnostics that treat multiple identification as an empirical
          question rather than an assumption. The intuition is familiar from linear algebra: if the relevant first-stage
          components are nearly collinear, you do not have enough independent variation to estimate multiple effects
          precisely.
        </p>

        <div class="subhead">A diagnostic lens: near-degeneracy and precision loss</div>

        <p>
          A practical contribution of the paper is a screening approach for near-degeneracy, based on the conditioning of
          the system implied by the first-stage fitted terms. Rather than asserting that multiple instruments “exist,” the
          diagnostic asks whether the first-stage transformations of <em>z</em> are sufficiently independent to support the
          second stage. When the system is poorly conditioned, inference can become sensitive to small perturbations—an
          issue that is often invisible when researchers focus only on conventional first-stage strength metrics.
        </p>

        <p>
          The broader point is methodological: in multi-endogenous IV problems, <em>relevance</em> is not just about whether
          each first stage is strong on its own. It is also about whether the set of identifying components is jointly
          informative—or whether they collapse onto essentially the same variation.
        </p>

        <div class="subhead">Why this matters for applied research</div>

        <p>
          This paper aims to be constructive for researchers who use IV in the real world, where clean instruments are
          scarce. If your instrument is “too powerful” in the sense that it plausibly affects many things, the standard
          response is often to abandon IV or to narrow the story until exclusion sounds believable. Our approach offers
          another option: treat that complexity as a feature of the data-generating process and build it into the
          identification strategy.
        </p>

        <p>
          At the same time, flexible first stages and control functions do not eliminate the core burden of IV logic.
          Researchers still need to think carefully about causal pathways and ensure that the model accounts for relevant
          channels through which the exogenous source may affect the outcome. What the approach provides is a clearer
          framework for doing that work—and diagnostics that help distinguish stable identification from near-collinearity.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you use IV regularly—or review papers that do—this is the paper’s bottom line:
          <strong>non-linear first stages are not a technical embellishment. They can be the difference between a weak or biased
          IV design and one that is both more credible and more informative.</strong>
